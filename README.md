# Statamic Theme for [Zurb Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com)
It's still in development (pre alpha stadium) so use it on your own risk!

## Getting started

### Include theme in statamic
I'm on a Mac so here is what I did: 

    ln -s path/to/folder/statamic-foundation /path/to/statamic/_themes/foundation
    
.. to create a symlink to the Theme

### Rename theme
The name of the theme is foundation to rename the theme:
- rename the folder to the name you want
- rename the *_scss/foundation.scss css/foundation.css js/foundation.js* to the same name
